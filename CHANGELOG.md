# Changelog

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-04

- Ringspo band palette: hero/title band is **signature green `#6cc8be`** with white text; lower content bands use **solid signature purple `#706cc8`** with white headings, body copy and links. Pricing context and Expert take remain white; subsequent odd sections (colour × clarity, FAQ, etc.) are full-bleed purple. Tables and charts inside purple bands sit on white cards so data stays readable.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-03

- Ringspo palette refinement: the hero/title band is now the **signature purple `#706cc8`** (was green), matching the brand header. Content sections below stay edge-to-edge and alternate white with a subtle **signature-green** tint (two brand colours only). All bands — hero, every content section, and the standalone title/breadcrumbs on size/other page types — use the same true `100vw` full-bleed, so nothing stops short of the viewport edges. CSS-only; plugin version bumped for asset cache-busting.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-03

- Ringspo pricing pages: new full-bleed **hero band** (`page_chrome.hero_band`) in the signature green (#6cc8be) grouping the title, breadcrumbs, hero chart (on a white card) and white headline stat cards (`hero_stats_html`: current price · diamonds analysed · price range · period change). Content sections below the band are white and edge-to-edge (single brand colour, sharp edges) — replacing the old alternating purple/green tint bands. Ringspo intro leads with stat cards (`page_chrome.intro_style: cards`) instead of the prose paragraph, and section order is Pricing context → Expert take. Loupe/other families are unaffected (flags off). Config bundle regenerated.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-07-03

- Headline price consistency: `intro_html()` and `stats_html()` now prefer the distribution **median** (`distribution.median_price` → `percentiles.p50`) for the lead sentence and "Current price" stat, falling back to `current_price` only when no median is present. This makes the intro, hero stat and carat-ladder table agree (e.g. $3,711 for 1ct round natural) instead of the intro leading with the outlier-inflated mean.

## [0.3.10] — 2026-07-03

- Fix fatal `TypeError` on individual size pages (e.g. `/diamond-size/round/1-carat/`): `individual_body_html()` referenced an undefined `$copy`, passing `null` to `variation_note_html(array $copy)`. The already-fetched size-copy payload is now threaded through from `render()`.

## [0.3.9] — 2026-07-03

- Size methodology copy only names the retailer count when it is a credible breadth signal (>= 15); below that the sample size (`n`) stands alone. Mirrors `RETAILER_COUNT_DISCLOSURE_THRESHOLD` in the Z3 artefact builder.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-07-03

- Face-up comparison UX (spread checker, comparison hub, curated pair pages): distinct fuchsia vs slate stone colours, winner callout, colour legend, horizontal face-up area bars with mm² difference (diamdb-style).

## [0.3.7] — 2026-07-03

- Size tool overlays (comparison pages, spread chart, comparison hub, spread checker) use faceted diamond line-art; shared `size-faceted-overlay.js`; manifests embed `faceted_shapes` from Z3.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-07-03

- Stone spread checker at `/diamond-size/spread-checker/`: free-form carat + L×W inputs for two stones, real-market percentile rank, face-up overlay, Z3 manifest artefact; mega hub CTA.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-07-03

- Comparison tool hub at `/diamond-size/compare/`: interactive shape/carat picker, live face-up preview, popular curated links, Z3 manifest artefact; mega hub CTA.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-07-03

- Size pages: deduplicated intro copy, singular/plural retailer phrasing, dynamic spread headings, L×W-first ideal vs real, histogram distribution chart, stroke SVG outlines, hub table thumbnails, shape/mega hub FAQs, full-bleed intro section colours.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-07-02

- Stamp plugin version in `WP_DEBUG_LOG` lines (`LDN_Plugin::debug_log`), staging diagnostics panel, and wp-admin Tools status.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-07-02

- Fix PHP 8.1 warning on non-shape pages: initialise `individual` in prefetch bag and guard `section_value()` bag access.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-07-02

- Fix PHP 8.1 fatal on pricing pages: remove trait constants from `trait-ldn-content.php` (PHP 8.2+ only); constants remain on `LDN_Renderer`.
